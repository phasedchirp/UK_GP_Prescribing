    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The UK's collection of open Prescribing datasets provide a fascinating window on the treatment practices in the UK. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anna Powell-Smith and Ben Goldacre of the EBM Data Lab at the University of Oxford have created the https://openprescribing.net/, a site with dashboards and a query engine for analysis and exploration of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ben Goldacre envisages this service being used by ['patients', 'local' and 'national journalists' and others] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-hvuEfUUOM). However, OpenPrescribing.net also has a number of [cautionary notes] (https://openprescribing.net/caution/) about selecting 'prescribing measures'.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen to explore what challenges may be present in choosing appropriate 'prescibing measures' by studying the underlying prescribing data itself. This also presents an opportunity to learn Python data manipulation and analysis libraries Pandas and Numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chosen subset of the data for this project describes prescribing behaviour in the UK for January 2016. It is 1.4GB of comma separated values representating about 10 million rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Dataset\n",

    "* medicines\n",
    "* dressings \n",
    "* appliances \n",
    "\n",

    "For each practice in England, the following totals are presented for each medicine, dressing and appliance, (by presentation name):\n",
    "\n",
    "* number of items prescribed and dispensed\n",
    "* net ingredient cost\n",
    "* actual cost\n",
